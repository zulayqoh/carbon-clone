### REPLICATE THE ONBOARDING PROCESS OF CARBON, SIGNUP AND LOGIN SCREENS USING PROGRAMMATIC UI

### Implementation Steps:

#### - Ensure your project is setup programmatically
#### - The onboarding screens (Screens 1 - 3)  should come first and in the order arranged here.
#### - When the user taps on Skip, it should go to the Register screen (Last screen).
#### - When Sign in is tapped on, it should present the Login screen (Screen 4)
#### - The signup screen should only have fields in conformity with the request as found in the API document.
#### - A document is attached with information about the API to hit when Signing in and Registering.
#### - When a user registers, it should navigate to the profile screen (Screen 5 & 6: 6 is a part of 5).
#### - The page should call the API to populate the necessary fields on the profile screen.
#### - The profile screen should only have fields that conforms with the expected response as laid out in the API document [HERE](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1p8b9OFMOC8O0bFnqLevpH1cgb3bmL2OUR3BK5UOq7kQ/edit)
